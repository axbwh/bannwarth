As part of this process, I led a complete rebrand, basing the amphibian theme on the <i>phyllomedusa bicolor</i> psychoactive frog. This involved designing the new tadpole logo, a tessellated frog pattern to be used across social, web and collateral, as well as the website’s copywriting and SEO. I then animated the pattern, using the metamorphosis of the frog as a metaphor for the studio’s development process .",
