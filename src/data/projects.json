Escher’s <i>Regular Division of the Plane</i> series, this project sets out to explore how computer automation can assist in the design of complex figurative tessellations. In a synthesis of creative coding and digital illustration, these artworks were produced with the help of custom built instancing and real time drawing assists, letting me visualise the entire pattern as I draw. This project is ongoing as I continue to refine my workflow and find new ways of creating these seamlessly interlocking patterns.",

As part of this process, I led a complete rebrand, basing the amphibian theme on the <i>phyllomedusa bicolor</i> psychoactive frog. This involved designing the new tadpole logo, a few variations of a tessellated frog artwork to be used across social, web and collateral, as well as the website’s copywriting and SEO.",
